                                Built by pilots and aerospace engineers who understand the importance of real-time information management and air-ground communications. When Kaydon Stanzione took his first solo cross-country flight at the age of 16, his mom and flight instructor waited anxiously for his “safe landing” call. Flying back then was only 40 years after Charles Lindbergh’s history crossing of the Atlantic Ocean! There just had to be a better way to communicate between air and ground crews, providing flight status and valuable in-flight situational awareness of performance, location, and health and usage of the air vehicle and it’s systems, passengers and cargo. That idea never left him and he combined several of his inventions in electronics, aviation, and telecommunications to form the backbone of the Airborne FRS family of products.  Affordable. Powerful. Always there, always aware!

                                The black box. Everyone has heard about it, unfortunately in the context of large commercial passenger airline accidents. Because of their high price, these sophisticated black boxes are essentially unavailable to other aspects of aviation such as General, Corporate, and Light Commercial aircraft. Airborne FRS is an affordable solution that is available in either a portable or fixed-mounted installation package. You can plug the Airborne FRS portable version in the aircraft's power socket, or mount the light-weight ALL-HAZARD, implosion unit anywhere in the aircraft's interior or externally such as in under the engine cowlings. Airborne FRS provides valuable information regarding the aircraft's flight path, geographic location, speed, altitude, heading, and other mission-critical facets of flight and pre-flight. Airborne FRS can also detect unauthorized use, electrical system problems, and can prevent engine start. You have invested a lot in your aircraft. Airborne FRS also provides important information not available from existing Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs). Get Airborne FRS today.

                                During periods of peak air travel in the United States, there are approximately 5,000 aircraft in the sky each hour. This equates to an estimated 50,000 aircraft in our nation’s skies every day. With a staggering number like this one, it is difficult to even fathom how the location and trajectory of each and every aircraft is monitored in order to promote both safety and smooth travel for all. Through the work of air traffic controllers, the takeoff, movement, and landing of both commercial and private aircraft is coordinated. Additionally, air traffic controllers ensure that aircraft are kept at safe distances from each other and are directed around bad weather to further prevent accidents and increase travel efficiency.

                                With the help of airborne flight information systems pilots are able to maintain contact with air traffic controllers and satellite communication networks. Specifically, the airborne flight information system is a powerful, two-way network in which flight crews can utilize both VHF and satellite communication networks from anywhere in the world. However, some pilots of small aircraft fly by vision only (visual flight rules, or VFR) as they are not required by the FAA to file flight plans. Moreover, with the exception for FSS and local towers, unlike pilots of large commercial flights, these pilots of small aircraft also are not serviced by the mainstream air traffic control system.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p-null">
                                While it may at first seem benign to allow the pilots of small aircraft to fly by vision only, there is much to be said about the value of tracking all aircraft, no matter its size, for the purpose of safety, security, business efficiency, and travel connections. Although flight information systems for small aircraft may seem out of the question for pilots (because of cost, maintenance, etc.), it is true that the ultimate payoff of aircraft tracking is greater than its initial investment. Flight information systems, through their flexibility in communication between cockpit and ground control, not only create smoother, more efficient flights, they save the lives of both their passengers and others. Because most human trafficking occurs in aircraft flying by VFR only, flight information systems in every aircraft have the potential to save hundreds of lives.
