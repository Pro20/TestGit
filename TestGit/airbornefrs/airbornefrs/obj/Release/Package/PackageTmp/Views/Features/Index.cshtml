                                Airborne FRS provides a portable Flight Management System (FMS) that offers many fundamental features found in modern, more expensive systems. By simplifying and reducing a wide variety of in-flight tasks, air crews can concentrate on flight safety while ground personnel can receive automated updates of flight and systems status. Airborne’s built-in library of airports can help augment navigation and serves as a directory for ground services. Crews can geofence waypoints and send automated alerts to predefined groups of people.

                                As any test pilot could tell you, the discipline of planning for both positive and adverse outcomes is one of the most essential elements in the mysterious mix that makes up the “right stuff” to be a pilot. For a good pilot, that right stuff includes solid training, regular practice, and the discipline to strive for proficiency and perfection on every flight. It includes understanding your aircraft’s systems — how they work, how they fail, and how those failures could affect other systems or controls.

                                In light of the recent ruling by the FAA allowing the use of Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs), during all phases of flight, there has been concern regarding the safety issues behind the ruling. However, the PED Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC) concluded that most commercial airplanes can indeed tolerate radio interference signals from PEDs. In a recent report, the ARC recommended that the FAA provide airlines with new procedures to assess if their airplanes can tolerate radio interference from PEDs. Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices – such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones – at all altitudes. In rare instances of low-visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing. The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during takeoff and landing.
